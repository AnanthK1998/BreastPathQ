# BreastPathQ
SPIE Medical Imaging 2019 Challenge

The BreastpathQ is an Image Regression challenge which asks us to predict the cancer cellularity of the tissue in the image. I have modified the activation of the last layer of the ResNet model to 'sigmoid' to give us regression values between 0 and 1.
